Pinvis is a 3D binary executable file visualization tool.

A video demo is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8NPgr5jvN4


BUILD:
> vi Makefile.pin.gnu.config #set PIN_HOME to the rootdir of pintool
> make
> ./runpin
> ./runpinvis streamcount.bin


KEYBOARD/MOUSE COMMANDS:
left click:	highlight stream
1:	Grid view
2:	Row view
3:	Memory access coloring
4:	Execution frequency coloring
8:	Trackball camera mode
9:	UFO camera mode
n:	next stream in timeline
p:	previous stream in timeline
h:	hide all streams from same image as highlighted stream
u:	hide all streams except those from same image as highlighted stream

Trackball camera mode:
left mouse button:	rotate scene
right mouse button:	zoom in and out
space bar:	reset to home view

UFO camera mode:
UpArrow: 	Acceleration forward.
DownArrow: 	Acceleration backward (or deceleration forward).
LeftArrow: 	Rotate view and direction of travel to the left.
RightArrow: 	Rotate view and direction of travel to the right.
SpaceBar: 	Brake. Gradually decelerates linear and rotational movement.
Shift/UpArrow: 	Accelerate up.
Shift/DownArrow: 	Accelerate down.
Shift/LeftArrow: 	Accelerate (linearly) left.
Shift/RightArrow: 	Accelerate (linearly) right.
Shift/SpaceBar: 	Instant brake. Immediately stop all linear and rotational movement.
When the Shift key is released, up, down, linear left and/or linear right movement is decelerated.
Parameters:
Ctrl/UpArrow: 	Rotate view (but not direction of travel) up.
Ctrl/DownArrow: 	Rotate view (but not direction of travel) down.
Ctrl/LeftArrow: 	Rotate view (but not direction of travel) left.
Ctrl/RightArrow: 	Rotate view (but not direction of travel) right.
Ctrl/Return: 	Straightens out the view offset.


TODO:
Use ManualExamples/invocation.cpp to instrument routines?
instruction-level visualization
memory visualization
return visualization
pintool filtering
better camera control
syscall visualization??
button overlay
QT-ify
testing
start pintool from within pinvis & connect with FIFO or similar, for realtime updates
filter by process/function (from pintool or vistool)
try parent injection?
